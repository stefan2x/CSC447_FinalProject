That is, the programming of artificial intelligence that takes into account the country of origin of the titles reinforces the consumption of titles from the same country.\n","\n","Below we will see the indications of the Mexican film **Pan's Labyrinth**, we will use two parameters, the cosine indications with and without country, for two different users, one that gave the film a maximum score and another that gave a minimum score.

Conclusion\n","\n","In this notebook, I built 4 different recommendation engines based on different ideas and algorithms.

The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate the ratings on which the rating was ultimately held.\n","2. **Content-Based Recommender:** We have created two content-based engines; one that took the general synopsis of the film and called as input and the other that took metadata like cast, crew, genre and keywords to make predictions. We also implemented a simple filter to give more preference to movies with more votes and higher ratings.\n","3. **Collaborative Filtering:** We use the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine provided estimated ratings for a given user and movie.\n","4. **Hybrid Engine:** We brought together content ideas and collaborative filtering to create an engine that gave movie suggestions to a given user based on estimated ratings calculated internally for that user."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
